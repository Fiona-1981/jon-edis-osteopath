This is my first piece of voluntary work.

Since I announced to people that I'd done a software engineering
bootcamp, there has been a handful of requests for websites, which
although isn't my ultimate aim (I like SQL too much), it is
great practice on HTML and CSS and is pushing me to really 
understand it from the ground up, rather than just throwing it
into a project in a rush and hoping for the best. I feel that
already, even while the site is in its embryonic stages, some
flashes of deeper understanding are going into my head. It occurs
to me that during the bootcamp, you don't have time to pause
and allow information to absorb. So whilst I was hesitant to
begin with, I've just looked at the clock and realised how 
absorbed I've been for the last couple of hours, so I am 
grateful that I decided to say yes to this project, whether it
goes ahead to deployment or not.
