    <h4>What do you offer?  </h4>
    <ul>
    <li>I offer private osteopathic consultations for adults (18+) in Greenwich.  </li>
    
    </ul>
    <h4>Do I need a doctor's referral to see you?  </h4>
<ul>
<li>No - you can just <a href="./contact.html" class="link-on-white">contact me</a> to make a private appointment.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>What is osteopathy?  </h4>

<ul>
<li>Osteopathy is a system of diagnosis & treatment for a wide range of medical conditions. It's based on the 
  principle that well-being depends on the skeleton, muscles, ligaments & connective tissues functioning smoothly together. </li>
<li>In the UK, osteopathy is designated by the NHS as an <b>Allied Health Profession</b>. It is regulated by the <b>General 
  Osteopathic Council (GOsC)</b>, with which all osteopaths must be registered.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Who & what do you treat?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Osteopaths treat everyone but I specialise in treating <b>adults (18+)</b> - I don't work with children (or animals!). </li>
<li>Examples of the conditions I see are low back & neck pain, shoulder problems (e.g. frozen shoulder), certain 
  types of headaches, muscle & tendon strains (e.g. tennis elbow), joint pain (e.g. arthritic pain) & nerve problems 
  (e.g. sciatica).  </li>
  <li>There is limited evidence that it may help to relieve symptoms of some other conditions such as irritable bowel 
    syndrome (IBS) & asthma.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>What are your qualifications?  </h4>
<ul>
<li>I have a BSc (Hons) in osteopathy, qualifying in 2001. </li>
<li>I am fully insured & am registered with the GOsC, 
  <a href="https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/register-search/registrants/5715-mr-jonathan-edis/" target="_blank" class="link-on-white">registration number 4616.</a> 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How long is an appointment?</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a new patient, you're with me for about 45 minutes; follow up sessions are shorter at about 20-25 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What happens in an appointment? </h4>
<ul>
<li>After we discuss your issue, I will examine you using palpation (medical touch) & watch you doing some simple 
  movements; I may also do some other checks, like your blood pressure.  </li>
<li>If appropriate, I will treat you with manual therapy. Wider management might include information, reassurance, 
  advice & simple exercises. </li>
  <li>
    For more information about what to expect, please see the infographic. 
  </li>
</ul>
      <h4>What treatments do you use?</h4>
      <ul>
<li>I use stretching, manipulation, muscle energy technique, massage (very occasionally!) & a gentle form of osteopathic 
manipulation called <b>Still Technique</b>. </li>
<li>I do not offer cranial osteopathy.</li>
      </ul>

<h4>Will you give me medication for my issue? </h4>
<ul>
<li>No - I cannot prescribe medication, though I may suggest you consult your pharmacist or GP if I think it 
might be helpful during your course of treatment. </li>
</ul>

<h4>How many sessions will I need? </h4>
<ul>
<li>That depends! On average, a course of osteopathic treatment is around 4-6 sessions. </li>
<li>Many simple, short-term problems often clear up quickly with self-care & little need for treatment; more 
persistent problems may require more sessions & a more diverse approach. </li>
</ul>

<h4>What if you can't help me? </h4>
<ul>
<li>If I don't think your problem is appropriate for osteopathic care, we will discuss referral to another 
health care professional, such as your GP. </li>
</ul>

<h4>About me</h4>
<ul>
<li>I'm an osteopath, international lecturer & clinical educator who's worked in various private, NHS & 
osteopathic education settings. I have a degree in history & am a (bad) poet. I'm also a full-time dad to two daughters. </li>
</ul>
