This is my first piece of voluntary work and a screenshot of how it looked\
at the inception!

Since I announced to people that I'd done a software engineering\
bootcamp, there has been a handful of requests for websites, which\
although isn't my ultimate aim (I like SQL too much), it is\
great practice on HTML and CSS and is pushing me to really \
understand it from the ground up, rather than just throwing it\
into a project in a rush and hoping for the best. I feel that\
already, even while the site is in its embryonic stages, some\
flashes of deeper understanding are going into my head. It occurs\
to me that during the bootcamp, you don't have time to pause\
and allow information to absorb. So whilst I was hesitant to\
begin with, I've just looked at the clock and realised how \
absorbed I've been for the last couple of hours, so I am \
grateful that I decided to say yes to this project, whether it\
goes ahead to deployment or not.
