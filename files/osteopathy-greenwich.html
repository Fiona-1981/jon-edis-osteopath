    <h3>Osteopathy in Greenwich, UK</h3>
    <p>Osteopaths are manual therapists. This means that I've been trained to use my hands in your examination & 
      treatment, though there is more to osteopathic practice than that.</p>
    <p>You do not need a referral from a GP to make an appointment with me, just contact me directly. My consulting room 
      is just off Royal Hill in Greenwich, a short distance from the town centre, close to Greenwich Park.</p>
    <p>If you come to see me, the first thing we do is spend some time discussing your issue - this allows me to 
      get some ideas about you, your problem, your expectations & whether I can help.</p>
    <p>If appropriate, I will physically examine you. I will watch you do some simple movements & palpate you 
      (this is just the medical term for using hands to examine). Depending on your problem, I might also use some 
      medical kit (e.g. thermometer, stethoscope etc.) that your GP might use; however, I am not able to undertake other, 
      more complicated medical tests such as blood tests or imaging.</p>
    <p>This exam leads to an assessment of your problem, which I will discuss with you. If I think your problem is 
      appropriate for osteopathic care, we develop & agree a plan for treatment & management. </p>
    <p>I use my hands (them again!) to deliver osteopathic treatment, using a range of techniques that are appropriate to 
      your age & problem - these may include passive joint mobilisation, joint manipulation (called high velocity thrust or HVT), 
      muscle energy techniques (MET), massage (very occasionally) & a gentler form of osteopathic manipulation from the USA 
      called Still Technique. (I do not offer cranial osteopathy.)</p>
    <p>Wider management might include information, reassurance, advice & simple exercises. I cannot prescribe medication 
      for your problem, though I may suggest you consult your pharmacist or GP if I think it might be helpful during your 
      treatment.</p>
    <p>If I don't think your problem is appropriate for osteopathic care, or even if it is but we feel something should 
      also be checked, we will discuss referral to another health care professional, such as your GP. </p>
    <p>On average, a course of osteopathic treatment is around 4-6 sessions, though it will depend on the nature of your 
      problem & the shared decisions that we make in your care. Many simple, short term (acute) problems often clear up 
      quickly with simple self-care advice & little or no need for treatment; longer term, more persistent problems may 
      require more sessions & a more nuanced, diverse & integrated approach. </p>
    <p>
      For more information about how I could help & what to expect from a consultation, please look at the video & 
      info graphic below. I'm happy to answer any further questions you might have when you contact me.
