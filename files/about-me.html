    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am an osteopath, registered with the General Osteopathic Council (GOsC) in the UK (reg. number 4616) 
      & a lecturer in osteopathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I qualified from the British School of Osteopathy (BSO, now the University College of Osteopathy) in 2001 
      with a BSc (Hons) in Osteopathy. I have worked in various private, NHS & higher education settings, 
      specialising in the treatment of adults (18+); I do not work with children (or animals!).
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2002, I combined working in private practice in south east London with lecturing at BSO, taking a 
      full time academic & clinical role there in 2006. I gained a Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice 
      (PgCAP) from the University of Bedfordshire in 2009 & became a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) 
      in 2010. In 2016, I went part time to concentrate on my family & returned to private practice in 2023.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Since 2010, I have delivered post-graduate continuous professional development (CPD) lectures & 
      workshops in osteopathy. I specialise in Still Technique, & have taught in UK, Italy, Poland & 
      the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I follow West Ham Utd & England cricket (for my sins). I write & occasionally publish 
      poetry, co-running a small, local Poetry Society writing group. I also have a BA (Hons) History from the 
      University of York.
